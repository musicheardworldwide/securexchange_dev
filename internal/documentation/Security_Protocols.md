This document defines the Security Protocols & Data Protection Standards for SecureXchange, ensuring robust protection of user data throughout its system. 

## Security Protocols & Standards - Overview 
`This document outlines core security protocols to ensure a robust, compliant security profile for SecureXchange.

# Encryption Standards

- * Data at Rest*: Philosophy encrypt sensitive data using AES-256. This will include files, messages, and user data stored in the PostgreSQL database.
- * Data in Transit*: Use the TLS (1.2 or above) protocol to ensure secure communication between clients, server, and external services. 

# Access Control Policies 

- **Role-Based Access (RBAC)** : Using RBAC to define user level access protections, such as admin, user, etc., managed through Jango.
- **Attribute-Based Access (ABAC)** : Using user attributes (e.g., location, device type) to grant or restrict access based on compliance needs. 

# Secure Authentication Protocol

- *JWT Json Web Tokens** : Use JSWT for access tokens, with refresh tokens to manage sessions securely. 
- *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA**: Provide an optional additional security layer, escecially for administrative actions. 

# Audit Trail & Logging Requirements

- **Action Logging**: Track significant user actions (e.g., file access, login attempts) with timestamps, user IDs, and other pertinent metadata.
- **Imutable Logs** : Use append-only logs, ensuring they cannot be altered after creation, to protect against tampering.

# Compliance Documentation and Review

- **Data Retention and Deletion Policies** : Define retention periods for files, messages, and logs in line with privacy standards like GDPR.
- **External Security Audits:** Schedule external audits to detect vulnerabilities, ensuring the system meets the latest security standards.
