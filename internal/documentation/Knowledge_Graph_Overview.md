This document outlines the initial components and relationships for SecureXchange's Knowledge Graph. This graph will help structure interactions, dependencies, and data flows for the project. 

## Knowledge Graph Overview 

1. **Users** - Represents users who have access to the application. 
  - Relationships: Can interact with Files and Messages. 
  - Dependencies: Authenticated via JWT and stored securely in PostgreSQL. 

2. **Files** - Represent user files that have been uploaded, shared, and stored. 
  - Relationships: Owned and shared by Users, linked to access logs for audit. 
  - Dependencies: Encrypted with OpenSSL, and stored securely in the PostgreSQL database. 

3. **Messages** - System for secure messaging and communication between users.
  - Relationships: Sent between Users, linked to message logs. 
  - Dependencies: Encrypted using OpenSSL, and stored securely in the PostgreSQL database. 

4. **Authentication** - System for user authentication, connected to user accounts to securely log in.
  - Relationships: Links to Users for secure login, registration, and session handling. 
  - Dependencies: Configured with JWT and session handling. 
5. **Audit Logs*** - These are logs that capture actions in the application.
  - Relationships: Links to Files and Messages for tracking user actions.
  - Dependencies: Stored in PostgreSQL logs, and monitored to ensure security compliance. 

Next step: Docker configuration with containers and initial setup.
